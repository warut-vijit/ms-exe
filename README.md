### Current Version: 0.0.2-alpha

### About This Project

This project contains the main game executable, written in Python for use alongside the Ren'Py Launcher. More info on Ren'Py can be found [here](https://www.renpy.org/).

For this game, we are using version 6.99.12.2, which may change. Please discuss possible version changes on Discord.

### About Version Control

We will be using version control in order to keep track of builds. This will help reduce issues with conflicting scripts and possible bugs that might pop up. You can download Github for Desktop here on the site, or use the Git command-line tools, which can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Software Numbering System

There are many ways to keep track of versions, but for this project we'll be using the following:

major.minor.build-stage

Major numbers are reserved for finalized versions (i.e., the full game) and significant jumps in functionality.

Minor numbers are reserved for smaller changes, such as small feature additions or script changes.

Build numbers cover bug fixes, and are released the most frequently.

Stage designations work a bit differently - these are used to denote alpha, beta, and release candidate versions of softwate.
